# Details about the implementation
- When the link is shortened there is no transition effect as the GIF shows
- The real implementation would use Redux + Redux Saga to manage the states, but I used only the ReactJS state instead (for the sake of simplicity)
- I still don't have a Photoshop installed, so the measures are not exactly the same of the PSD (and I preferred rem and % instead)
- To generate the project, just run ```gulp``` or use ```gulp watch``` to serve it at the localhost

Cheers ;)
